# ddcc - Double-difference cross-correlation
Parallel double-difference cross-correlation code based on [pyasdf](http://seismicdata.github.io/pyasdf).

The aim of this code is to measure differential travel-times on large datasets via waveform cross-correlation for double-difference relocation of earthquakes.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/malcolmw/ddcc/wiki) for instructions on installing and using ddcc.
